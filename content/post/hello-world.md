## Introduction to myself

Hi! I am Rodrigo Cardoso Moreira a software developer since 2004, I've born in 1985, so I am a developer for a good part of my lifetime. I thought that now it's the right time to start to share some of my experiences and also learn during this process. I would like to advise that the content of this blogs are related to my point of view and also my understanding of the read of great authors I will probably use on my posts as reference.
